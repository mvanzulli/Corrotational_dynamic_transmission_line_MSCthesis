	abstract = {A systematic procedure is presented that may be used to extend the capabilities of an existing linear finite element to accomodate finite rotation analysis. This procedure is a generalization of the work presented in Computers and Structures, Volume 30, pp. 257-267. The basis of our approach is the element-independent co-rotational algorithm, where the element rigid body motion (translations and rotations) is separated from the deformational part of its total motion. The variation of this co-rotational relation results in a projector matrix, with the property that a consistent internal force vector is invariant under its action. The consistent tangent stiffness matrix is shown to depend on this invariance condition through the derivative of the projector. This results in an unsymmetric tangent matrix whose anti-symmetric part depends on the out-of-balance force vector. In this paper we prove that using the symmetric part of the tangent matrix, the Newton iteration retains its quadratic rate of convergence. This approach has been used to solve a number of large rotation test example problems. The results demonstrate that it is possible to analyze structures undergoing large rotations within a general co-rotational framework, using simple and economical finite elements. The resulting improvements in the performance of these simple elements are brought about through the use of convenient software utilities as pre- and post-processors to the element routines. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

	abstract = {The present paper investigates the formulation of 3D co-rotational beam elements for the buckling and post-buckling analysis of frame structures. Following Pacoste and Eriksson [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 144 (1997) 163], the term co-rotational relates here to the provision of a local reference frame that continuously rotates and translates with the element. Within this context, several issues are emphasised. The first one refers to the parameterisation of finite 3D rotations. The alternative put forth in the paper is based on the spatial form of the incremental rotational vector. The second issue concerns warping effects which are introduced by adding a seventh degree of freedom at each node. Different types of local formulations are considered and it is shown that at least some degree of non-linearity must be introduced in the local strain definition in order to obtain correct results for certain classes of problems. Within the present approach the centroid and shear center of the cross-section are not necessarily coincident. Finally, in the context of instability problems, a method for the direct computation of critical points is also briefly discussed. This is based on a minimal augmentation procedure as developed by Eriksson [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 156 (1998) 45; Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 179 (1999) 265; Int. J. Struct.

In this paper, a new corotational formulation for dynamic nonlinear analysis is presented. Cubic interpolations are used to derive both the inertia and elastic terms.

As a consequence, cubic interpolations are adopted to formulate both inertia and internal local terms. In the derivation of the dynamic terms, an approximation for the local rotations is introduced and a concise expression for the global inertia force vector is obtained. To enhance the efficiency of the iterative procedure, an approximate expression of the tangent dynamic matrix is adopted. Four numerical examples are considered to assess the performance of the new formulation against the one suggested by Simo and Vu-Quoc (1988) [48]. It was observed that the proposed formulation proves to combine accuracy with efficiency.

@article{DiPilato,
	abstract = {Cables are very efficient structural members widely used in many mechanical, civil, electrical and ocean engineering applications. Due to their slenderness and flexibility, they have a dynamic behaviour strongly affected by various nonlinear phenomena. In this work a numerical procedure is enhanced to study the nonlinear interaction between flexible structures and a fluid flow. The numerical procedure is based upon the Newmark method, modified according to Hilber, Hughes and Taylor, and on finite elements capable of computing the cable mechanical response as well as the interaction forces induced by a steady or random wind flow. A three-node cable isoparametric finite element (FE) in the small strain and large displacement regime was formerly used in Martinelli {\&} Perotti (2001-2004); however, whenever rotations are large, C 0 models based on nodal displacements are inappropriate for capturing the system response since they cannot fully describe the system orientation. Moreover, when these models are augmented with local degrees of freedom to describe the cable twist, the nodal equilibrium conditions are not fully satisfied. Recent studies on cable dynamics show that flexural stiffness plays an important role, especially in low-tension cables. It can be also noted that neglecting flexural stiffness can lead to singularities as numerical algorithms may become unstable when the tension approaches zero anywhere along the cable. Moreover unacceptable errors in the prediction of high order frequencies can also arise (see Koh {\&} Rong (2004)). These problems were initially faced in Di Pilato et al. (2007), where the cable was described using two different superimposed FEs: a corotational 3D beam element used to compute the nodal restoring forces considering large displacements and rotations, and a second corotational 'aerodynamic' element (three-node isoparametric FE) for evaluating the aerodynamic nonlinear forces within the Quasi-Stationary theory in the varied dynamic configuration. The main idea of the corotational formulation is to decompose the motion of the element into rigid body and pure deformational parts through the use of a local (corotational) reference system (Figure 1a). The geometric non-linearity due to large displacements and rotations is incorporated in the transformation matrices relating local to global (Figure 1b) coordinates. {\textcopyright} Museo Ideale L.

@article{Foti2016,
	abstract = {Spiral strands are lightweight and flexible structural elements, widely employed in many different applications, moreover, they are the basic components of stranded wire ropes. Bending behavior can play an important role in modeling slack cables and in "critical" regions of flexible ropes, such as in the neighborhood of clamping devices. When a strand is bent, wires tend to slip relatively one to each other. In the present work, the critical conditions for the onset of inter-layer sliding are investigated by defining the limit domain for wire slipping (the domain of "admissible values" for the axial force of a generic wire, accounting also for the contribution due to bending of the strand). The special case of uniform bending of the strand is considered and a closed form expression of the limit domain is presented. The non-holonomic nature of the strand mechanical model developed in this work leads to a lacking of symmetry for the tangent stiffness matrix. In the paper it is proved that this condition can be de facto relaxed in practical applications and that an elastic potential function, relating the generalized stress and strain variables of the strand in bending, can be defined only under the limit kinematic hypotheses of "full stick-state" or of "full slip-state". The aforementioned results are used as the starting block from which the strand full mechanical behavior for coupled axial force and bending is derived. Knowledge in closed form of how the limit domain depends upon the strand construction parameters and current stress conditions paves the way to design optimization of the strand.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for conductors under simultaneous tensile and bending loads. The proposed conductor model takes into account the interlayer friction and the interlayer slip in the conductor during bending and leads to a variable bending stiffness, i.e. a stiffness which changes with the bending displacement and the tension applied to the conductor. The theoretical concept is validated by extensive tests using an innovative measurement setup, the “cable-scanner”, which detects, by noncontact scanning of the conductor surface, the displacement and the curvature of the conductor axis},
