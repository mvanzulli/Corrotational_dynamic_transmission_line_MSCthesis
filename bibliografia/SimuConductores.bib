@article{Papailiou1997,
	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for conductors under simultaneous tensile and bending loads. The proposed conductor model takes into account the interlayer friction and the interlayer slip in the conductor during bending and leads to a variable bending stiffness, i.e. a stiffness which changes with the bending displacement and the tension applied to the conductor. The theoretical concept is validated by extensive tests using an innovative measurement setup, the “cable-scanner”, which detects, by noncontact scanning of the conductor surface, the displacement and the curvature of the conductor axis},

@phdthesis{Kutterer1992,
	abstract = {Closed-form expressions for the dynamic stiffness functions of a damped cable and a damped, axially prestressed beam element, are given. A dynamic damping phenomenon of a single cable is described. For a multiply-guyed mast, dynamic response functions are evaluated. Influence of cable dynamics is investigated. In case of internal resonance, the dynamic stiffness function of a cable decreases and may become negative. Nevertheless, the response function for the composed system is favourably influenced by cable vibration. This effect is quantified by means of a stochastic analysis of the system response to random excitation. The study is restricted to linear theory; validity of linear theory is discussed.},
